# Atlassian Data Center

A Raycast extension for Atlassian Data Center products, providing search capabilities for Confluence and Jira with CQL/JQL syntax support.

## ⚙️ Setup Required

This extension integrates with your Atlassian applications using Personal Access Tokens (PATs), which are a secure way to authenticate external applications. [Learn more](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep your Personal Access Token secure. If compromised, revoke it immediately.

On first use, you'll need to provide:

- **Confluence Base URL**: Base URL of your Confluence Data Center instance, e.g., `https://confluence.example.com`
- **Confluence PAT**: Create it from Confluence → Profile → Personal Access Tokens → Create token
- **Jira Base URL**: Base URL of your Jira Data Center instance, e.g., `https://jira.example.com`
- **Jira PAT**: Create it from Jira → Profile → Personal Access Tokens → Create token
